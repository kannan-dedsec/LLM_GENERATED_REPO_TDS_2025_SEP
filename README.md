# Twitter Clone

A simplified, front-end Twitter-like application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates core functionalities such as posting new tweets, displaying a dynamic tweet feed, and basic interaction like liking tweets. It serves as a foundational example for building social media interfaces.

## Demo

*   **Live Interaction:** Open `index.html` in your web browser.
*   **Posting Tweets:** Type your message in the "What's happening?" textarea and click the "Tweet" button to instantly add your tweet to the top of the feed.
*   **Liking Tweets:** Click the heart icon on any tweet to toggle its like status and update the like count.
*   **Placeholder Actions:** The reply and retweet buttons provide a JavaScript `alert` as their full functionality is not implemented in this basic version.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Tweet Feed:** View a list of tweets displayed in chronological order.
*   **Tweet Posting:** Easily compose and publish new tweets to the feed.
*   **Like/Unlike Functionality:** Interact with tweets by liking or unliking them, with visual feedback and count updates.
*   **User Profiles:** Each tweet displays a user's avatar, username, and handle.
*   **Modern Styling:** A clean and intuitive interface inspired by Twitter's design language, using custom CSS.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the `index.html` file):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-clone.git
    cd twitter-clone
    ```
2.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser.
    ```bash
    # On most systems, you can just open the file directly
    open index.html
    ```
    The application will load directly in your browser, ready for interaction.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the application, including layout, colors, and design elements.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For dynamic behavior, handling user input, managing the tweet feed, and implementing interactive features.

## Future Enhancements

This project is a starting point and can be expanded in many ways:

*   **Backend Integration:** Connect to a server-side API and database to persist tweets, user data, and implement full user authentication.
*   **Reply & Retweet Functionality:** Implement actual reply threads and retweet mechanisms.
*   **User Profiles:** Dedicated profile pages for users.
*   **Hashtag & Mention Parsing:** Automatically link hashtags and mentions in tweet text.
*   **Media Uploads:** Allow users to attach images or videos to their tweets.
*   **Search & Trends:** Add features to search for tweets or see trending topics.
*   **More Robust UI/UX:** Further refine the design and user experience, including full responsiveness.
